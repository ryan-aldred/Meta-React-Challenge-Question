Things that could be better

- Better type validation for form data
- Sort each list
  - Avoid doing `evt.target as HTMLFormElement`
- Better file and function names
  - FancyThing is a bad name
- Better component organization
  - sub folders for components
- Better style
  - Use Tailwind or at least css modules
